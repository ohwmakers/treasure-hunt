# Open Hardware Treasure Hunt

Welcome to this repository! 🎉 🚀

## Background

We created this game for our MozFest 2021 session. 
This was the description:

> Open Hardware Treasure Hunt in an online game that will let you experience first hand what is and why it’s important to have more open hardware around the world. Inspired in our mentorship program “Open Hardware Makers”, you will join an online activity that will take you on a journey through what makes an open hardware project great. Be ready to follow the traces we will have prepared for you and make sure you get the treasure in the end!

## Tools we used

Well.. just [twinery](https://twinery.org/). A great tool for non-linear, web-based stories.
Ah .. and our 🌈✨ imagination ✨🌈
